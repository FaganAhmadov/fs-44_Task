    <h1> Game Characters </h1>
    <br>
    <p>The main character Pacman was made friendly so people could associate themselves with him. The role of enemies in
        Pac-Man is played by four colorful ghosts:</p>

    <h1><b>Level 256</b></h1>


    <p>The first person to beat Pac-Man was American Billy Mitchell. When the creator of the game, Tohru Iwatani, met
        with him, Billy asked if some of the features he discovered had been deliberately allowed. Iwatani consulted
        with colleagues and replied as follows:</p>

    <p> <i>Mr. Mitchell. We do not know. The game was not supposed to last that long.</i></p>
    <p>As conceived by the developers, Pac-Man was not supposed to have an end, since the increasing complexity of the
        game would not allow it to go far. However, some players were able to complete 255 levels of the game, which
        took several hours, and at 256 level they discovered the manifestation of a programming error in the form of a
        «screen of death».

    <h1>Reprints</h1>
    <p>In 2010, on the 30th anniversary of the game, Google introduced a thematic <a href="index.html">«doodle»</a> .
        The maze design was a Google logo, but the graphics, sounds, and ghost behavior patterns copied the original
        game. When you press the «Insert coin» button again, Mrs. Pacman appears on the screen, and the game can be
        played together on the same keyboard.</p>
