    </b>


    <h2>General Information
    </h2>

    <p>Space Invaders is a 1978 arcade shooting game developed by the Japanese company Taito. It became a cultural
        phenomenon and one of the earliest games that created massive global hype. The player controls a laser cannon,
        moving horizontally across the bottom of the screen while shooting descending aliens before they reach the
        ground.
    </p>
    <p>According to developers, the original idea was inspired by a mix of <i>Star Wars, War of the Worlds,</i> and
        traditional
        shooting ranges. Interestingly, the game was supposed to feature tanks and soldiers, but technical limitations
        forced Taito to use simple alien shapes instead.
    </p>
    <h2>Gameplay Mechanics
    </h2>

    <p>The alien formation moves left-to-right, gradually accelerating as more invaders are eliminated. Once they hit
        the screen boundary, they descend one level and change direction. The tension increases as the sound effects
        speed up, creating a sense of panic deliberately engineered by the developers.

    </ul>

    <h2>Alien Types
    </h2>

    <p>Space Invaders features a structured alien army arranged in rows. Although simple, each type behaves differently
        and grants different points:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Squid Invaders:</b>Top-row invaders worth the highest points.</li>
        <li><b>Squid Invaders:</b>Top-row invaders worth the highest points.</li>
        <li><b>Squid Invaders:</b>Top-row invaders worth the highest points.</li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Top-row invaders worth the highest points.</h2>
    <p>On level 256, a strange phenomenon occurs—similar to the Pac-Man glitch. A memory counter used by the game
        overflows, causing corrupted graphics to appear on the screen. Players refer to this as the <b>“Vertical Memory
            Collapse”</b>.
